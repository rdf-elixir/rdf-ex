defmodule RDF.Util.Regex do
  @moduledoc """
  Some of the regular expressions in the code base get executed in quote tight
  loops, sometimes millions of times. The elixir code base does a check on every
  run of a compiled regex, to check if the pcre version of the regex matches the
  version that the local OTP version got compiled against. This check seems to
  be unexpectedly costly (there is acall though to :erlang.system_info/1). It
  seems worth it performance wise to circumvent elixir here, and call throughÂ to 
  erlang 're' in this case.
